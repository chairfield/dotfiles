* Application Support
Create one MacOS App per chemacs profile.

** Rationale
This offers two key benefits:
- Application launcher (e.g., Alfred) support
- Concurrent Application instances for running multiple Emacs configurations side-by-side

** Instructions
Using Platypus (=brew install --cask platypus=), configure each App with the following settings:
- Interface :: None
- Run in background :: true
- Remain running after exectution :: false
- Create symlink to script and bundled files :: true

Save each App in the Application folder.
