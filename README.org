* My Dotfiles

This is my first attempt at a homegrown dotfile management repo.

It's based on Donald Knuth's [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf][Literate Programming]] methodology, but built with
Emacs' [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] and its feature to [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][extract source code]], called _tangling_. To
understand its implementation, begin by reviewing [[https://github.com/chairfield/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/tangle][bin/tangle.sh]] and [[https://github.com/chairfield/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile][Makefile]].

I make this project public for educational purposes only.

** Acknowledgments

I wish to thank the following authors for heavily inspiring the architecture of
this repo:
- Lee Hinman, over at [[https://writequit.org][writequit.org]] and his [[https://github.com/dakrone/eos][Emacs Operating System]] project, for
  providing the core approach to generating my dotfiles via org-tangle
- The [[http://doc.rix.si/cce/cce.html][Complete Computing Environment]] for inspiring both Lee and myself
