* My Dotfiles

This is my first attempt at a homegrown dotfile management repo.

It's based on Donald Knuth's [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf][Literate Programming]] methodology, but built with
Emacs' [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] and its feature to [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][extract source code]], called _tangling_. To
understand its implementation, begin by reviewing [[https://github.com/chairfield/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/tangle][bin/tangle.sh]] and [[https://github.com/chairfield/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile][Makefile]].

I make this project public for educational purposes only.
