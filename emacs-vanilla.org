#+TITLE: Vanilla Emacs config

:END:
Mostly unused, I keep a custom, mostly-vanilla Emacs configuration. It helps
give me a better sense of what [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] and [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] offer.

This configuration is both slow to load and produces errors the first time it's
run, but serves its purposes regardless.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle sh/install-emacs-vanilla.sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/emacs-vanilla
ln -svf $PWD/out/emacs-vanilla-init ~/.config/emacs-vanilla/init.el
#+END_SRC

** init.el
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: init-el

Setup the [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]] package archive.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle out/emacs-vanilla-init
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

Load MELPA package list, a very expensive step.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle out/emacs-vanilla-init
(package-refresh-contents)
#+END_SRC

Install and enable the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][Evil]] vi layer.

=custom-set-variables= and =custom-set-faces= are Emacs- rather than
Evil-specific and will need to be factored out in the future. According to the
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil documentation]], including them doesn't appear necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle out/emacs-vanilla-init
(unless (package-installed-p 'evil)
  (package-install 'evil))
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
