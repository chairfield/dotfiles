# My Dotfiles
This is my first attempt at my own dotfile management repo. I've
made it public for educational purposes only.

While the application-specific configuration is largely my own, I owe debts of
gratitude to the following projects for heavily inspiring the architecture and
principles of this repo:
* Lee Hinman, over at writequit.org, and his [Emacs Operating
  System](https://github.com/dakrone/eos) project, for providing the core
  approach to generating my dotfiles via org-tangle
* The [Complete Computing Environment](http://doc.rix.si/cce/cce.html) for
  inspiring both Lee and myself
