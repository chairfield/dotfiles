My [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippet]] repository, for sharing one set of snippets between my Emacs configurations.
* Troubleshooting
** Snippet expansion inserts a trailing newline
Most likely, there's a trailing EOF in the snippet file. The following script will safely remove one only if it exists:
#+BEGIN_SRC
perl -pi -e 'chomp if eof' file
#+END_SRC
