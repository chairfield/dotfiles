* Introduction
[[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippet]] is a powerful template system for Emacs. It's feature-rich (see
[[http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/][documentation]]) and isn't tied to any Emacs major mode (e.g., Org-mode's
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html][structure templates]]).

Snippets are stored in plain text files and are thus shareable across my Emacs
profiles.

Invoke snippets in insert mode by typing one's =key= followed by =TAB=.

** Install script
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle sh/install-emacs-snippet-dir.sh
ln -svf $PWD/snippets ~/.emacs-snippets
#+END_SRC
